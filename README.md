<h2>Research Question</h2>


Are counties with a higher concentration of super-spreader businesses associated with increased risk of COVID-19 transmission?
 
### Aim 1: Classify businesses into super-spreaders and not super-spreaders based on frequency and duration of visits pre-pandemic.

### Aim 2: Identify association between counties with higher super-spreaders and COVID-19 cases.

## Datasets

This survey by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank seeks to collect information on national education responses to school closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire is designed for Ministry of Education officials at central or decentralized level in charge of school education. The questionnaire does not cover higher education or technical and vocational education and training. Analysis of results will allow for policy learning across the diversity of country settings in order to better inform local/national responses and prepare for the reopening of schools.

The Survey was administered by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS). How is the survey conducted? The Survey is available in four languages (English, French, Spanish, and Russian) and can be submitted by email or an online survey platform.
